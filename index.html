      <h1>From Pablo, </h1>
      <h2>
        Well I been holding on this project for about a year and I kinda wanted to hold into it until it was the right time. Took about roughly a 6 months to get working the way how I wanted. But say, I hope you like it :)
      </h2>
      <h2> To the beginning (We said about a thousand time lol), I remember that we first saw each other. I asked you if you are going to retreat and to this day, you was looking shocked with your mouth open with your sweet ass voice ü•∫. Later on we got so close that I actually blush really hard and I was nervous to asked you if you liked me while my heart was pounding fast.</h2>
      <h2>Eventually, we had a movie date and I never blushed so hard before, I thought we was going to be kissing but I was scared. I'm glad that I asked you on the 30th. I remember you wore a a stripe shirt with Converse beautiful dress. You were so beautiful that I went home and cry about it. You are the most beautiful women I've ever met and there is no way I won't let my eyes off you even if we go separate ways. </h2>
      <h2> Then we took this iconic picture ü•∫</h2>

      <h2> We saw together almost everyday and you put a simle to my face. We set our bars high that we did it together in our first month. I'm never felt truly in love. We laugh, cried, and loved together.</h2>

      <h2> Years later, It felt like I just dated you like it was yesterday.</h2>

      <h2> And just like what you said, "A relationship is between 2 people and nobody else."</h2>
      <img src="thanks.jpg" alt="love u" style="width:500px; height: auto px;">
      <img src="love u.JPG" alt=" i really love you"
      style="width:500px; height: auto px;">
      <h2> In the end, I will always love you forever. I know we rarely see each other now, but small little things makes everything for it. I can't let my eyes off you. You are so pretty and beautiful Ashley. You so special and that's from the bottom of my heart I'm happy to be with you ‚ù§Ô∏è </h2>
      <img src="idk.jpg" alt=" thank you">
      <h2> Update: I know we broken up and single but we are taking a break. I miss our relationship alot. I'm currently just trying to stay focus on myself and change who I was to make you happy. I feel like a bad guy the whole time. I'll ask you on the right time and I have for you surprise üëÄ. I love you and I hope you heal and recover. For now, kisses on the forehead and later we can go back to the lips ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è </h2>
